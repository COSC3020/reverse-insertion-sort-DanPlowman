# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

In the lectures, we covered that insertion sort has best-case time complexity of
$\Theta(n)$ and worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$. What is the
average-case time complexity ($\Theta$)?

Hint: Think about what happens in each iteration of the loop, and how often the
loop is executed. Keep in mind that for asymptotic analysis we don't care about
constant factors.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is
most important -- you can easily find the answer, but you need to demonstrate
that you've understood the concept. Add your answer to this markdown file.

The worst-case time complexity of Insertion sort is n^2, this occurs when every element is in reverse order and the maximum number of swaps need to be made. For the average case, we could reason that the inner loop doing the swaps is not going to have to return through the entire array every time. But it will still need to do some work. So this has more than n complexity, because the middle loop executes more than once, but less than the worst case complexity of n^2. this n^2 complexity could be reduced by a coefficient that represents probabilities of numbers needing to be swapped, but for asymptotic time complexities these coefficients should be excluded, so the average time complexity must be n^2 as well.
